## Featured Presentation:
**Introduction to Query Store**\
_Carlos Robles, Principal Consultant DBA Mastery_\
\
Fixing SQL Server performance problems and detecting query regressions has been always challenging for DBAs, we have to deal with the fact that SQL Server does not capture query performance stats permanently on disk. Query Store is a new feature introduced in SQL Server 2016, which automatically captures a history of queries, plans, and runtime statistics, and retains these for later review. Join me in this session, where we will be discussing more about Query store architecture, configuration and uses for real world scenarios.
